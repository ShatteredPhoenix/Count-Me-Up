<h2>Project name: Count Me Up</h2>
<b>Description:</b> <br>
This is a technical assignment that had to be done for the BBC Hiring Event

<h3>Information: Initial Branch:</h3>

This branch contains my initial netbeans implementation which is based on object oriented programming principles, the users and candidates are represented as objects and it simulates a system where the users vote randomly for one of 5 candidates. limiting each user to 3 votes. It then displays the results as total number of votes per candidate and the over percentage of the votes they recieved. 

<h3>Information Master Branch:</h3> 
The master branch contains an upscaled version of the project which is a java web application that simulates the way I interpreted the assignment. The application uses a MySQL database to store registered users with their votes left, in addition to candidates with the amount of votes each one has recieved so far. 

It allows uses to login or sign up (as only registered users can vote) to the system and vote for their candidate of choice, each user is limited to 3 votes and the login/signup page regularly updates the current results live every second on the screen.
